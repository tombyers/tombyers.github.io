* this is a fundamental topic. relates to premature abstraction, dropdowns, hiding options in UX, all of which have been covered before. but it's an important one, so I'll tackle it from a different angle.

* the mess gives me clues

* humans are quite good at scanning a long list of items, especially where there are ways to make sense of / chunk the list (e.g. date last edited, picture thumbnails etc).

* don't cluster things that are already clustered / easy for me to mentally cluster

* understanding ambiguity as I go is helpful - it lets me ask questions if needed

* if you want to categorise stuff, think carefully about the names you give things. better still, get others to think carefully about the names they'd find useful (card sorting), then test whether they're right (tree testing).

* if you want to put time into organising, focus on naming stuff better first

Imagine your at someone else's house and they ask you to make a cup of tea for them. You need to locate a kettle, teabags, sugar, milk and a teaspoon.

Imagine how mad it would be if they organised these items into cupboards labelled as follows:

* Kitchen Applicances > Heating things > Water > Kettle

* Food & Drink > Drink > Hot drinks > Jane's Favourite May 2018 > Earl Grey > Teabag

* Food & Drink > Food | Drink > Baking | Lunchbox > Sugar

But this is what people seem to do when they're organising files & folders. And the irony is, they think that by being organised, they're being helpful.

Maybe you're looking for a logo file. This should be easy...

The designer has organised them as follows:

* Digital | Print

* White | Black | Colour

* Square | Inline | Logomark

* Archive | Current

There's only 1 or 2 files in each folder - about 12 variants overall. Think how much easier it would be to just scan a list, especially if that list has other information: thumbnail, recently updated, file type
