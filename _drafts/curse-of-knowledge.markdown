What does the Curse of Knowledge feel like?
For the person with the knowledge:
* How can it be so difficult?
* I don't want to be annoying, but please let me help you.
* I know you're not stupid. Why are you making this so difficult?
* "I can't watch."
* I'm gravely disappointed in you, my student.
* Work with me.

For the person without the knowledge:
* Woah, this person is a genius.
* This person is SO pretentious. How brazenly can they talk about such hifalutin nonsense?
* This is an impenetrable wall of jargon.


Things can be impenetrable because they're too specific for an audience or too abstract. You need to meet them at their level.
