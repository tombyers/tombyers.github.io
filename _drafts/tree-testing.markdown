The challenge:

* this is what we want

* this is the challenge

The good news:
There's a really simple and fast way to test

Other conclusions:

having a mechanism - the simpler, the better - to assess your product / app / website in a way that a) involves other people, b) is objective 

The value of tree testing (and of all usability testing) goes beyond the data you collect and the conclusions you're able to draw. It also helps you have better, more collaborative and efficient meetings. It's no longer one person's word against someone elses; you have a shared reference point and mechanism for discussing points of contention in a way that's grounded in reality and from the perspective of the user.

People need to know where to look for information.
The problem is that many websites may be organised in a way that makes sense to the internal team, but how do you know it makes sense to an external viewer?

Information Architecture

People don't know where to look for information.

Should I focus more on Maze or more on tree testing?

What is a tree test? How do you use it?

* helps you keep the user in mind; what are they actually trying to do

* people might not arrive at your home page. Or maybe they just don't scroll enough to see your thoughtfully considered links.

* people use flashy terms or product names. But unless these mean something don't.

Process:

* explain how to setup a prototype in Sketch / InVision / Figma

* import into Maze

* send out links

* review heat maps

Given that every organisation seems to struggle with effective sharing of information (at my last job, a colleague described saving something to our Sharepoint as 'soft delete'), I can imagine that tree testing would be a very useful way of addressing this.
