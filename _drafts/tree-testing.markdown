For a good user experience, people need to be able to find what they're looking for on your website. This is harder to achieve than it might sound. And without a frame of reference, it's very hard for us to know if we're achieving it or not. 

Optimal Workshop has a dedicated tree testing tool called Treejack. You upload a spreadsheet mapping out the navigation structure you want to test, it creates the test and stores and charts the results for you. Optimal Workshop is expensive however (and the free trial is very restrictive, only allowing you to get 10 responses to any one tree test). So I used the free tier of [Maze](https://maze.design) to do the same job. Here's how. 

The Curse of Knowledge 

We naturally become very familiar with what we're working on while we work on it. For website creators, this means we come to know its content inside-out. We know exactly how it fits together. And we know the business . We're spending day after day reviewing content, polishing designs, 

Given that every organisation seems to struggle with effective sharing of information (at my last job, a colleague described saving something to our Sharepoint as 'soft delete'), I can imagine that tree testing would be a very useful way of addressing this.

The challenge:

* this is what we want

* this is the challenge

The good news:
There's a really simple and fast way to test

Other conclusions:

The value of tree testing (and of all usability testing) goes beyond the data you collect and the conclusions you're able to draw. It also helps you have better, more collaborative and efficient meetings. It's no longer one person's word against someone elses; you have a shared reference point and mechanism for discussing points of contention in a way that's grounded in reality and from the perspective of the user.

People need to know where to look for information.
The problem is that many websites may be organised in a way that makes sense to the internal team, but how do you know it makes sense to an external viewer?

Information Architecture

People don't know where to look for information.

Should I focus more on Maze or more on tree testing?

What is a tree test? How do you use it?

* helps you keep the user in mind; what are they actually trying to do

* people might not arrive at your home page. Or maybe they just don't scroll enough to see your thoughtfully considered links.

* people use flashy terms or product names. But unless these mean something don't.

Process:

* explain how to setup a prototype in Sketch / InVision / Figma

* import into Maze

* send out links

* review heat maps
