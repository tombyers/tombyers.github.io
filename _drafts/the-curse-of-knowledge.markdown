Applies to all sorts of areas:

* magic tricks, once learned, look obvious and basic. It's hard to see how anyone would be fooled by it. But they are. Here, magician's are taking advantage of the curse of knowledge. They understand how hard it is for someone who doesn't know what's going on, doesn't know what to expect or what to attend to, to spot the clues of how they're being deceived.

The curse of knowledge is also what underpins lots of roundabout conversations on what the best solution is.
