Inspired by Ben Holliday's post "Everything is hypothesis-driven design", I structured an iterative approach to tree testing around it.

We did a baseline test - how does our current site structure perform. Then I could come up with a number of hypotheses about how to improve it. 

Because we think that...
We think that by...
We will 
We will know if this is the case by...

It worked really well. I think that the biggest gain is not in the work itself but in communicating and documenting the work to a team. It's a structured and logical decision log.
