I took a lot from [watching this interview](https://vimeo.com/99675815) with Russell Davies. 

It's about the role of planners. What they do, how they've helpful, where organisations struggle. There are lots of great lines in it, here's a few of my favourites.

There are lots of great lines in it.
The most important skills for a planner to have:
* get people to do stuff, because that is the largest problem for all organisations is people don't do anything.

Strategy and cleverness and original ideas are all useless is no-one does anything. As you get more senior, your job is to get more people doing something. Planning adds that false certainty of seeming a bit like science. There are 6 answers, they're all pretty good but this is the one where we can actually do something.

Quant research & focus groups. Any decent planner could get a focus group to say anything they want. It's used for the wrong things; to decide if an idea is good or not. "Oh they think that, therefore it's wrong."

> People don't know what they think about things they've seen, let alone things they need to imagine they've seen.

> Planning was one of the things that advertising invented that will outlive advertising. It basically invented a discipline that requires you to be good at synthesising lots of different information, condensing it, understanding it and representing it in a way such that people do stuff. That's a really useful skill in large organisations. It's a useful thing generally.
