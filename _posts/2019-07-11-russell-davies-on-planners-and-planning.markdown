> "Planning was one of the things that advertising invented that will outlive advertising. It basically invented a discipline that requires you to be good at synthesising lots of different information, condensing it, understanding it and representing it in a way such that people do stuff. That's a really useful skill in large organisations. It's a useful thing generally."

I got a lot out of watching [this interview](https://vimeo.com/99675815) with Russell Davies. It's about planners and planning.

There's a number of great lines in it. 

He says that the most important skill for a planner is the ability to "get people to do stuff. Because that is the largest problem for all organisations - people don't do anything... As you get more senior, your job is to get more people doing something".

It's a great reminder to value execution over precious ideation. As Russell says, "Strategy and cleverness and original ideas are all useless if no-one does anything."
