Sometimes, after things have been 'tidied up', the only person who can actually find what they need is the one that did the tidying.

"Charlie. You packed for our holiday, didn't you. Where d'you put the suncream?"
"Jo, have you re-organised our holiday photos? Where do I find the pictures from Italy?"

The response to these questions is sometimes an exasperated one: "Well, where d'you think it'll be?". After spending time and effort thoughtfully organising things, it's hard to understand how someone else can have such trouble using our system. It's just them being lazy, we think.

As the person who did the organising, we know what we've stowed where. We also know *why* we put it there; we understand the reason behind it and the system we used. And of course the system we used makes perfect and obvious sense to us, otherwise we wouldn't have used it.

It's so hard for us to un-know these things and appreciate what it's like to try to find something in our new system without this knowledge.

This phenomenon has a name: the Curse of Knowledge. On its [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge) it's defined as "a cognitive bias that occurs when an individual, communicating with other individuals, unknowingly assumes that the others have the background to understand".

This problem is a common theme across all sorts of communication and collaboration. Some people, known as Information Architects, spend their careers solving this problem, organising and labelling information to make it useful and findable to everyone who might need it.

How they go about that is a subject for a future post. For now, the conclusion is not necessarily to stop being so organised, as the title of this post instructs, but be sure to think hard about the labels and signposts you use.
