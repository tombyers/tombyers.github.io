Hello, I'm Tom Byers. 

I'm a user experience designer. I work at [Sensyne Health](https://www.sensynehealth.com) in Oxford, designing software used by NHS clinicians and patients. Software that's *actually* nice and easy to use. 

Before Sensyne Health, I was a product designer and frontend developer at [Repositive](https://repositive.io). Repositive is a social enterprise helping researchers find and access genomic data. I've also had roles in market research, business development, sales and marketing at companies like [Hubl](http://www.hubl.co.uk), an early-stage logistics startup, and [Nuun Hydration](https://nuunlife.com), an American sports nutrition brand.

I like to take a hypothesis-led approach to design work. In practice, this means laying out design decisions like this:

* Because we think that **this** is true...
* we think that by doing **this**...
* **this** thing will happen.
* We'll know that this is true / false when we see **this** indicator change.

I like this approach not just because I think it's the best and most focused way to iteratively improve a product. It's also because it makes collaboration easiest. It gives everyone a shared understanding of the problem and the priority. It provides a framework for people to debate their preferred solutions. And it helps document decisions in an agile design process.

I also place a strong emphasis on usability testing.
