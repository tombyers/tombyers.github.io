Hello, I'm Tom Byers.

I'm a user experience designer. I work at [Sensyne Health](https://www.sensynehealth.com) in Oxford, designing software used by NHS clinicians and patients. Software that's *actually* nice and easy to use.

# Experience

Before Sensyne Health, I was a product designer and frontend developer at [Repositive](https://repositive.io). Repositive is a social enterprise helping researchers find and access genomic data. I've also had roles in market research, business development, sales and marketing at companies like [Hubl](http://www.hubl.co.uk), an early-stage logistics startup, and [Nuun Hydration](https://nuunlife.com), an American sports nutrition brand.

# Around the web

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ts_byers), [Github](https://github.com/tombyers), [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/tombyers) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-byers/). Alternatively, email me directly: **tombyers@pm.me**.
