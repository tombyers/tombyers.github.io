Hello, I'm Tom Byers. 

I'm a user experience designer. I work at Sensyne Health in Oxford, designing software used by NHS clinicians and patients. Software that's actually nice and easy to use. 

Before Sensyne Health, I was a product designer and frontend developer at Repositive. Repositive is a social enterprise helping researchers find and access genomic data. I've also had roles in market research, business development, sales and marketing at companies like Hubl, an early-stage logistics startup, and Nuun Hydration, an American sports nutrition brand.

My design work tends to be structured and hypothesis-led, with a strong emphasis on usability testing. This isn't just because I think it's the best way to improve a design (although I do). It's also because it makes collaboration easiest. It gives everyone a shared understanding of the problem and the priority. It provides a framework for people to debate their preferred solutions. And it helps document decisions in an agile design process.
